What is an Local Education Agency,"LEA is the local education agency, also referred to as the local school district.",
What is Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,"IDEA is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Federal special education law that guarantees FAPE.",
What is Free Appropriate Public Education,"FAPE is Free Appropriate Public Education, the provision in IDEA to ensure states provide services to eligible students with disabilities.
The FREE in FAPE means school services must be provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, without charge. Uniformly assessed fees are permissible. A fee for a service may be charged only if this is a fee for all students in the school. The term ""at no cost"" does not preclude incidental fees that are normally charged to students without disabilities or their parents as part of the regular education program.
Appropriate doesn’t mean the best. It means, All students, including those performing at grade level and those unable to perform at grade level, the school must offer an IEP that is “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress in light of the child’s circumstances.”",
What is an Individualized Education Plan,IEP is an individualized Education Program that provides a written plan designed to meet the unique needs of the child with an exceptionality.,
What is Least Restrictive Environment,"LRE is least restrictive environment. LRE is the foundation principle in IDEA that children with disabilities should be educated with their nondisabled peers, to the greatest extent possible.",
What is Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports,"Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports is an evidence-based three-tier framework for improving and integrating all of the data, systems, and practicing affecting student outcomes every day. It’s a way to support everyone – especially students with disabilities – to create the kinds of schools where all students are successful.
PBIS isn’t a curriculum you purchase or something you learn during a one-day professional development training. It is a commitment to addressing student behavior through systems change. When it’s implemented well, students achieve improved social and academic outcomes, schools experience reduced exclusionary discipline practices, and school personnel feel more effective.","Center for Positive Behavior Interventions & Supports, a U.S. Department of Education funded Technical Assistance & Dissemination Center"
What is a Functional Behavioral Assessment,"A functional Behavioral Assessment is used to determine the function of the behavior and the factors that maintain it.  It helps teachers to understand the reason(s) (i.e., the function or functions) for a student’s behavior and then to use this information to design an intervention that will help the student learn a new, more acceptable method of getting what he or she wants. In many cases, challenging behaviors are an inappropriate way for a student to either obtain something desired (e.g., attention, a tangible item) or avoid something not preferred (e.g., a task or activity). An FBA should be considered when basic classroom interventions are ineffective and when the behavior:
• Could cause injury to the student or others
• Is intense or occurs frequently
• Places the student at risk for referral to special education or a more restrictive placement","The IRIS Center, a U.S. Department of Education funded Technical Assistance & Dissemination Center"
What is a Behavior Intervention Plan,"A BIP is a Behavior Intervention Plan.  Many students with disabilities – particularly those with emotional or behavioral disorders, have IEP’s that contain a BIP, which provide individualized procedures to prevent undesirable behaviors or to intervene when those behaviors occur.  ","The IRIS Center, a U.S. Department of Education funded Technical Assistance & Dissemination Center"
What is a Manifestation Determination Review,"A Manifestation Determination Review is used if a student with a disability violates the school’s code of conduct, the student’s IEP team must meet to determine whether the behavior was the result of either:
• The student’s disability, or
• Poor implementation of the student’s IEP.",
What is Child Find,"The LDE shall ensure that: 
     a. all students with disabilities residing in the state, including students with disabilities who are homeless children or who are wards of the state, and students with disabilities attending private schools, regardless of the severity of their disability, and who are in need of special education and related services, are identified, located, and evaluated; and 
     b. a practical method is developed and implemented to determine which students are currently receiving needed special education and related services. 

2. Each public agency, in accordance with the requirements of these regulations, shall document that on-going identification activities are conducted to identify, locate, and evaluate each student who is suspected of having a disability, in need of special education and related services, and meets the criteria listed below: 
     a. is enrolled in an educational program operated by or under the jurisdiction of a public agency; 
     b. is enrolled in a private school program within the geographical jurisdiction of a public agency; 
     c. is enrolled in a public or private preschool or day care program; or 
     d. is not enrolled in a school, except for students who have graduated with a regular high school diploma.","Louisiana Bulletin 1706, §111 A"
Should I have my child evaluated for special education,"If your child is between 3 and 21 and having academic, social, or behavioral problems, you may consider getting your child evaluated. In Louisiana, this is called a 1508 evaluation. Many struggling learners first go through the School Building Level Committee (SBLC) and receive interventions (RTI) before they are referred for an evaluation.",
What is Response to Intervention,"The Response to Intervention (RTI) process is a three-tiered approach to providing services and interventions to struggling learners and/or students with challenging behaviors at increasing levels of intensity. Essential components of the process include three tiers of instruction and intervention, use of standard protocols and/or problem-solving methods, and an integrated data collection/assessment system to inform decisions at each tier of instruction/intervention. The process incorporates increasing intensities of instruction and/or intervention that are provided to students in direct proportion to their individual needs. Embedded in each tier is a set of unique support structures or activities that help teachers implement, with fidelity, research-based curricula, instructional practices, and interventions designed to improve student achievement. RTI is designed for use when making decisions in both general and special education, creating a well-integrated system of instruction and intervention guided by student outcome data.","Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §301"
What is the School Building Level Committee,"The School Building Level Committee (SBLC) goes by several different
names, but all have the same function. Some districts call it the Student
Assessment Team, Academic Behavior Intervention Team and other
names. This group is a general education, data driven, decision-making
committee whose standing members consist of at least the
principal/designee, a classroom teacher, and the referring teacher. In
discussing an individual student's difficulties, the student's parent or
guardian is an invited participant. The SBLC shall review and analyze all
screening data, including RTI results, to determine the most beneficial
option for the student. The committee's options include, but are not
limited to one of the following actions:

     1. Conduct no further action at this time.
     2. Continue current intervention and progress monitoring through
the RTI process.
     3. Conduct additional interventions through the RTI process.
     4. Refer the student to the appropriate committee to conduct a
Section 504 evaluation.
     5. Refer the student to pupil appraisal personnel for support
services.
     6. Refer the student to pupil appraisal p","Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §303"
Can the school district refuse to evaluate my child until he or she goes through the Response to Intervention process,"No, The Office of Special Education Programs under the U.S.
Department of Education made it clear a school district cannot delay or
deny the evaluation process due to RTI. ","(OSEP Memorandum dated January 21, 2011)"
Can the school use my private evaluation to expedite the evaluation process,"The school district is required to review all pertinent reports supplied
by the parent or an outside agency during the evaluation process.
Normally, these private evaluations don’t meet the requirements of 1508
and therefore the district will conduct their own evaluation. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §513 A 3) "
Is the public school system required to evaluate my child that attends a private school for free,"Yes, if you suspect your child is a child is a disability, the public school
system is obligated to evaluate your child under Bulletin 1508 guidelines,
at no cost to the parent or private school your child is attending. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §103 A 2)"
What does 1508 evaluation mean,"Bulletin 1508 is the regulatory guide for pupil appraisal personnel
when conducting individual evaluations of students suspected of being
exceptional and in need of special education and related services, and as
a reference for persons requiring specific information regarding the
determination of eligibility for special education services","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §101 A)"
What are the exceptionalities,"The exceptionalities are Autism, Deaf-Blindness, Developmental
Delay, Emotional Disturbance, Hearing Impairment, Intellectual Disability,
Multiple Disabilities, Orthopedic Impairment, Other Health Impaired,
Specific Learning Disability, Speech or Language Impairment, Traumatic
Brain Injury, Visual Impairment,","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508. §701, §703, §705, §707, §709, §711, §713, §715,

How long does it take to get my child evaluated,"The initial evaluation must be conducted within 60 business days of
receiving parental consent. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §511 A)"
Can the school ask for evaluation extensions,"If the LEA begins an evaluation and there are fewer than 60 business
days remaining in the LEA's current school year, the LEA may take this type
of extension with parent permission. However, the number of days used
between the parental signature and June 1 will be subtracted from the 60
business days, and the timelines will begin again on September 1.

If the LEA is making sufficient progress to ensure a prompt completion
of the evaluation but needs extended time to assess the student in all
areas of the suspected exceptionality, the parent and the LEA may agree
to a specific time when the evaluation will be completed.

Extensions are not allowed during expedited evaluations for students
subject to disciplinary measures as referenced in n §534 of Bulletin 1706.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §511 A-B)"
What happens if the parent disagree with the evaluation,"The parents of a student with a disability or an exceptionality have a
right to obtain an independent educational evaluation (IEE) of the student
as described in Chapter 5 of Bulletin 1706.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §515)"
"If my child is eligible for special education services, how long will it take to start the services","The local education agency (LEA) also referred to as the school district
has a maximum of 30 calendar days to complete the IEP/placement
document for an eligible student. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §105 A)"
Will I receive a notice about the Individualized Education Plan meeting,"Yes, a written notice must be provided to the parents of the child. The
notice must be provided in the parents’ native language or shall be given
using other means of communication, whenever necessary, to ensure
parental understanding. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §105 A 1)"
Does the school have to tell me who will be attending the meeting,"The notice shall indicate the purpose, time, and location of the IEP Team
meeting; who will be in attendance; when a LEA IEP Team member
needs to be excused from attending the meeting; the parents' right to
take other participants to the meeting; the student's right to participate
(when appropriate); and the name of the person in the LEA the parents
can contact when they have questions or concerns ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §105 A 1 b-f)"
Who are the Individualized Education Plan team members,"At any IEP Team meeting, the following participants shall be in
attendance: an officially designated representative of the Local
Education Agency (LEA), the student's regular education and special
education teachers, the student's parents, and a person knowledgeable
about the student's evaluation procedures and results. The student, as
well as other individuals the parents and/or LEA may deem necessary,
should be given the opportunity to attend. Documentation of
attendance is required. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 A)"
Are parents equal Individualized Education Plan team members,"Yes, parents are equal participants in the IEP process in discussing the
educational and related services needs of the student and in deciding
which placement and other services are appropriate. As such, one or
both of the student's parents should participate in the initial
IEP/placement meeting(s). Other team members shall rely on parents to
contribute their perspective of the student outside of school. Parental
insight about the student's strengths and support needs, learning style,
temperament, ability to work in various environments, and acquired
adaptive skills is of vital importance to the team in making decisions
about the student's needs and services. The concerns of the parents for
enhancing the education of their child shall be documented in the IEP. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 A 2)"
Who is considered a parent on the Individualized Education Plan team,"Parent is defined as a biological or adoptive parent of a child; a foster
parent; a guardian, generally authorized to act as the child's parent or
authorized to make educational decisions for the child, but not the state
if the child is a ward of the state; an individual acting in the place of a
biological or adoptive parent of a child (including a grandparent,
stepparent, or other relative) with whom the child lives or an individual
who is legally responsible for the child's welfare; or a surrogate parent
who has been appointed to act in the child's behalf. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 A 2 a, d)"
What is the parent of the child has a disability or doesn’t speak English,"The Local Education Agency (LEA) shall take measures to ensure that
parents and all other team members, including sensorially impaired and
non-English-speaking participants, can understand and actively
participate in discussions and decision-making. These measures (i.e.,
having an interpreter or translator) should be documented. LEAs shall
further ensure that, for those parents who cannot physically attend the
IEP Team meetings, every effort is made to secure parental participation. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 A 2 b)"
Is the student required to attend the Individualized Education Plan Meeting,"The student should be given the opportunity to participate in the
development of the IEP. In many cases, the student will share
responsibility for goals and objectives.
The Local Education Agency (LEA) shall invite a student with a disability
at any age to attend his or her IEP Team meeting if the purpose of the
meeting will be the consideration of postsecondary goals and the
transition services needed in reaching those goals. The LEA shall invite
the student and, as part of the notification to the parents of the IEP
Team meeting, inform the parents that the LEA will invite the student to
the meeting. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 A 6)"
"Can Individualized Education Plan members miss the Individualized Education Plan meeting, come in late, or leave early","A member of the IEP Team is not required to attend an IEP Team
meeting, in whole or in part, when the parent of the student with an
exceptionality and the public agency agree, in writing, that the
attendance of the member is not necessary because the member's area
of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed
in the meeting.

A member of the IEP Team may be excused from attending an IEP Team
meeting, in whole or in part, when the meeting involves a modification
to or discussion of the member's area of the curriculum or related
services, when:

     a. the parent, in writing, and the public agency consent to the excusal;
and b. the member submits, in writing to the parent and
     b. the IEP Team, input into the development of the IEP prior to the
meeting.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §107 B 2)"
Is there a time limit on Individualized Education Plan meetings,"Nowhere in the regulations address a time limit on IEP meetings. The
law doesn’t provide any guidance on the minimum or maximum amount
of minutes to meet. But the meeting should be long enough to provide
the team enough time to plan a unique and appropriate IEP for your
child. If for some reason you feel rushed, you can always ask to
reconvene the meeting at another time. If the members of the team
start the meeting stating they have a limited amount of time, let them
know you are happy to go as far as they can, but will reconvene if it isn't
done or feel like it’s being rushed. An initial IEP meeting could last as
long as a few hours, depending on the needs of the child.

Unfortunately, some schools will try to schedule a lot of IEP's on certain
days and block out specific short time frames. This is completely
inappropriate for an initial IEP meeting or any annual IEP meetings.
There is no way you can adequately go over the necessary IEP items in a
predetermined minimum period. As a rule of thumb, plan on an hour at
a minimum.",
Who can have access to my child’s Individualized Education Plan,"The student's IEP is accessible to each regular education teacher, special
education teacher, related services provider, and any other service
provider who is responsible for its implementation; and
1. Each teacher and provider is informed of:
a. his or her specific responsibilities related to implementing the
student's IEP; and
b. the specific accommodations, modifications, and supports that shall
be provided for the student in accordance with the IEP. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §109 A)"
Are there different types of IEPs,"Yes, there are three types of IEPs for Students with exceptionalities. The
Initial IEP is developed for a student with an exceptionality who has met
criteria for one or more exceptionalities outlined in Bulletin 1508, Pupil
Appraisal Handbook and who has never received special educational
services, except through an interim IEP, from an approved Louisiana
school/program.

The Review IEP is reviewed and revised at least annually or more
frequently to consider the appropriateness of the program, placement,
progress in the general education curriculum and any related services
needed by the student.

The Interim IEP shall be developed for students who have severe or low
incidence impairments documented by a qualified professional
concurrent with the conduct of an initial evaluation according to Bulletin
1508, Pupil Appraisal Handbook.

An interim IEP may also be developed for students who have been
receiving special educational services in another state concurrent with
the conduct of an initial evaluation.

An interim IEP may also be developed concurrent with the conduct of an
initial evaluation for a student out-of-school, including students ages
three- through- five, who are suspected of having a disability and for
former special education students, through the age of twenty-two, who
have left a public school without completing their public education by
obtaining a state diploma.

Can an Individualized Education Plan be amended without a meeting,"In making changes to a student's IEP after the annual IEP Team meeting
for a school year, the parent of a student with a disability and the public
agency may agree not to convene an IEP Team meeting for the purposes
of making Title 28, Part XCII 5 Louisiana Administrative Code March 2011
those changes, and instead may amend or modify the student's current
IEP.

1. Procedural safeguards for reconvening the IEP Team meeting shall be
followed. 
2. If changes are made to the student's IEP, the LEA must ensure that the
student's IEP Team is informed of those changes.
3. Changes to the IEP may be made either by the entire IEP Team at an
IEP Team meeting or by amending the IEP rather than by redrafting the
entire IEP.
4. A parent must be provided with a revised copy of the IEP with the
amendments incorporated. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §113 A)"
What does placement mean,The term placement refers to the setting or class in which the student will receive special educational services.,"(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §115 A)"
How is placement decided,"The IEP Team, following a discussion of the student's educational needs, shall choose a setting in which the educational needs will be addressed. The official designated representative shall be knowledgeable about placement considerations and shall be responsible for informing the IEP Team members. The IEP Team, including the parent, shall participate in discussions and decisions made about the placement.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §115 A)"
What type of discussion or issues should be considered when deciding placement,"Placement Considerations for Students with Disabilities whose ages are
6-21.
1. For the location of instruction/services, IEP Team members should
consider the following.
a. Where would the student attend school if he or she did not have a
disability?
b. Has the student, as a special education student, ever received special
educational instruction or services within the general education
environment?
c. What accommodations and/or modifications have been used to

providing services in the general education classroom?
f. Based on IEP goals and/or objectives/benchmarks, what instructional
settings would support the achievement of these goals and/or
objectives/ benchmarks?
g. When the decision has been made to provide the student with
instruction and/or services outside the general education setting, what
specific opportunities will the student have for integration in general
education activities?

If the child is between 3 and 5, the following is considered: 

For the location of instruction/services, the IEP Team should consider
the following.
a. Where would the student spend the majority of the day if the student
did not have a disability (natural environment)?
b. Can the services identified on the IEP be provided in the student's
natural environment?
i. If not, what changes should be made in that environment to enable
the required services to be delivered there?
ii. If not, what programming and/or placements/services options are
necessary to meet the student's identified needs while providing
meaningful opportunities for interactions with peers without
disabilities?
c. What accommodations, supports, and/or related services are needed

What are the placement options for a child 3 to 5 years of age,"For Students with Exceptionalities Ages 3-5. In determining the
appropriate setting for a preschool-aged student, each setting noted
shall be considered; but the list should not be considered a continuum of
least restrictive environment. The settings for preschool-aged students,
three through five years, are defined as follows:
1. Attending a regular early childhood program at least 10 hours a week

buildings; hospital facilities on an outpatient basis, and libraries and
other public locations.",
Will my child go to their regular neighborhood school,"In most cases yes. Although, throughout Louisiana most students with
exceptionalities are served in their neighborhood schools there are some
extenuating circumstances that influence the decision to serve a student
in a school other than his or her neighborhood school. However, when
the site at which the student will receive services is not determined at
the IEP Team meeting, within 10 calendar days, the site determination
form shall be completed.

The LEA has the right to select the actual school site at which the
student will receive services. In addition to the questions on the IEP and
Site Determination Form, the following issues shall be considered:
1. Students should be placed in programs on the basis of their unique
special education needs, not as a result of their particular disabling
condition; and
2. Placement cannot be based either on a particular LEA's special
education delivery system or on the availability of related services.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §131)
(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §129 A-B)"
Do parents need to consent to special education services,"The LEA shall obtain formal parental consent before it can initially
provide a student with special education and related services in any
setting.

A student consent is needed once the student reaches the age of
majority, which is age eighteen in Louisiana, unless the student has been
determined to be incompetent under state law. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §119 A-B)"
What happens if I disagree with the services or placement in the Individualized Education Plan,"Parents may disagree with all or some parts of the program, placement,
or related services proposals. The LEA and the parents should make
conciliatory attempts to resolve the disputes, including making
modifications to the proposed program, placement, and related services.
A LEA may not use a parent's refusal to consent to one service or activity
to deny the parent or student any other service, benefit, or activity of
the LEA.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §121 A)"
What happens if I refuse to consent to the Individualized Education Plan,"When the parent of the student refuses to consent to the initial
provision of special education and related services, or the parent fails to
respond to a request to provide consent for the initial provision of
special education and related services, the LEA:

1. may not use the procedures in Bulletin 1706, Chapter 5 (including the
mediation procedures under §506 or the due process procedures under
§508-§517) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services
may be provided to a student;
2. will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make
FAPE available to the student for the failure to provide the student with
the special education and related services for which the public agency
requests consent; and
3. is not required to convene an IEP Team meeting or develop an IEP for
the student for the special education and related services for which the
public agency requests such consent. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §123 A)"
Can a parent revoke their consent for an Individualized Education Plan,"If, at any time after the initial provision of special education and related
services, the parent of a child revokes consent in writing for the
continued provision of special education and related services the LEA:
1. May not continue to provide special education and related services to
the student, but must provide prior written notice in accordance with
Bulletin 1706 before ceasing the provision of special education and
related services;
2. May not use the procedures in Bulletin 1706, Chapter 5 (including the
mediation procedures under §506 or the due process procedures under
§508-§517) in order to obtain agreement or a ruling that the services
may be provided to a student;
3. Will not be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make

the student for further provision of special education and related
services.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §123 B)"
"If the Individualized Education Plan team can’t come to an agreement, what options are available to resolve the disagreement","The Louisiana Department of Education has adopted written procedures
regarding the resolution of any complaint related to the identification,
evaluation, educational placement, the level of services or placement,
and the provision of FAPE. Options include:
1. IEP Facilitation is a new dispute resolution method. This option is
available to parents and school districts when they both agree that it
would be valuable to have a neutral person (IEP Facilitator) present at an
IEP Team meeting to assist them in discussing issues regarding the IEP.
Typically, an IEP Facilitator is brought in when parents and school district
staff are having difficulties communicating with one another about what
the student needs.

2. Informal Complaints/Early Resolution Procedures (ERP). It is the policy
of the LDE to encourage and support prompt and effective resolution of
any administrative complaint in the least adversarial manner possible.
The implementation of the ERP by each LEA draws on the traditional
model of parents and schools working cooperatively in the educational
interest of the students to achieve their shared goal of meeting the
educational needs of students with disabilities.

3. Mediation is an informal, voluntary process by which the parent and
the LEA are given an opportunity, through the help of a trained
mediator, to resolve their differences and find solutions to enhance the
overall learning environment for the student. Differences may arise in
the planning and implementing of an individualized educational program
for a student with an exceptionality. It is important for parents and LEAs
to have an opportunity to present their viewpoint in a dispute. See
Louisiana's Educational Rights of Children with Disabilities Handbook or
Louisiana's Educational Rights of Gifted/Talented Children in Public
Schools and the Mediation Services for Students with Exceptionalities
brochure for more information.

4. The parents and the LEA both have the right to an ""impartial due
process hearing"" when disagreements arise between the parent and the
LEA, relative to initiating or changing the identification, evaluation, or
educational services and placement of a student with an exceptionality.

Can my child attend an inclusion class,"IDEA nor Bulletin 1706 recognize inclusion, but they do recognize Least
Restrictive Environment (LRE). Each public agency shall ensure that:
a. To the maximum extent appropriate, students with disabilities,
including students in public or private institutions or other care facilities,
are educated with students who are nondisabled; and
b. Special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of students with
disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only if the
nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular
classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be
achieved satisfactorily. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1706, §114. A 1-2)"
Is there an age limit on the different ages in the same special education class,"Unless specifically permitted by the State Board of Elementary and
Secondary Education, there shall not be a chronological age span of
more than three years within a special education class.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §127 )"
How often do we have an Individualized Education Plan meeting,"An LEA is required to initiate and conduct IEP Team meetings
periodically, but not less than annually, to review each student's IEP in
order to determine whether the annual goals for the student are being
achieved and to revise the IEP as appropriate. The LEA shall notify
parents of the review IEP Team meeting in accordance with the same
procedures as the initial IEP.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §301 D)"
Can the school purchase my child an Assistive Technology Device,"Each public agency shall ensure that assistive technology devices or
assistive technology services, or both, as those terms are defined in
§905, are made available to a student with a disability if required as a
part of the student's:
1.        special education under §905;
2.        related services under §905; or
3.        supplementary aids under §§905 and 114.A.2.b.
B.        On a case-by-case basis, the use of school-purchased assistive
technology devices in a student's home or in other settings is required if
the student's IEP team determines that the student needs access to
those devices in order to receive FAPE.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1706, §105)"
How does my child qualify for Extended School Year Services (ESY),"The IEP Team will consider the criterion/criteria to make the ESY
determination and what data must be collected to make that decision.
The data collected through progress monitoring (e.g., grades, progress
reports, behavior checklists, task analyses, teacher observation logs,
etc.) shall be reviewed to determine the progress the student makes
toward acquisition of the measurable annual goals and/or
objectives/benchmarks, and whether the data supports that, the student
meets any of the criteria for ESY eligibility. ","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §303 A 15)"
Can my Child’s Individualized Education Plan include extracurricular services,"The LDE shall ensure the following:

1. Each public agency shall take steps, including the provision of
supplementary aids and services determined appropriate and necessary
by the student's IEP Team, to provide nonacademic and extracurricular
services and activities in the manner necessary to afford students with
disabilities an equal opportunity for participation in those services and
activities.

2. Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may
include counseling services, athletics, transportation, health services,
recreational activities, special interest groups or clubs sponsored by the
public agency, referrals to agencies that provide assistance to individuals
with disabilities, and employment of students, including both
employment by the public agency and assistance in making outside
employment available.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1706, §107 A-B)"
What is the age a child can receive special education services,"In Louisiana, qualifying children from birth through their 2nd birthday
can receive early intervention services through Early Steps. Federally, this is referred to as Part C Services under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

Qualifying students from 3 through 21 years of age can receive special
education services until:

a. The student receives a state diploma; or
b. The student reaches his or her 22nd birthday. When the 22nd
birthday occurs during the course of the regular school session, and all
action steps in the transition plan have not been completed, the student
should be allowed to remain in school for the remainder of the school
year.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1530, §103 C 2)"
Does my child have to fail in order to qualify for special education services,"No, the state shall ensure that FAPE is available to any individual student
with a disability who needs special education and related services, even
though the student has not failed or been retained in a course or grade,
and is advancing from grade to grade.",(Bulletin 1706. §101C)
Will students aging out of Early Steps automatically qualify for special education services,"Unfortunately no. IDEA requires that certain steps be taken when a
child transitions out of Early Steps services at age 3. It is required that the
Part C Lead agency, which is Early Steps in Louisiana, notify the LEA for the
area in which the child resides that the child will shortly reach the age of
eligibility for preschool services. Early Steps notifies the Louisiana
Department of Education (LDOE) of any children ages 2 years and 2
months or above. LDOE then sends the list of children to the appropriate
LEA. It is important that all options, including a referral to the local school
for special education services, be considered and discussed with the
family. A transition plan must be developed that identifies other
appropriate options for the child and family including private preschool,
Head Start, Early Head Start, the Office for Citizens with Developmental
Disabilities/Human Service Authority (OCDD/HSA/D), child care, or other
community early childhood programs. Even though EarlySteps send a list
to the DOE, the FSC is still responsible for notifying the LEA of the
impending 3rd birthday, inviting the LEA to the transition conference, and
sending the appropriate documentation that supports the transition
notification to the LEA.

If the parent wants to see if their child is eligible for an IEP, the school
district will then get consent from the parent to evaluate the child.
The state shall have in effect policies and procedures to ensure that:

1.        children participating in early intervention programs assisted
under Part C of the IDEA, and who will participate in preschool programs
assisted under Part B of the IDEA, experience a smooth and effective
transition to those preschool programs in a manner consistent with 
2.        by the third birthday of a child described in Paragraph 1 of this Section, an IEP has been developed and is being implemented for the child consistent with §101.B; and 
3.        each affected LEA will participate in transition planning conferences arranged by the designated lead agency under Section 635(a)(10) of the IDEA.",(Bulletin 1706. §101C)
Why does my child need to be evaluated by the school district if he or she already has an autism diagnosis from the doctor,"Typically a medical diagnosis doesn’t include the required information for a school classification. Unless your medical provider completed the required components of Bulletin 1508, they will need to meet the qualifications for Autism in Bulletin 1508.","(Louisiana Bulletin 1508, §701)"
Is Special Education only for children with intellectual delays?,"No, most children receiving special education or related services do not have intellectual delays. Special education services are available for any child, ages 3 to 21 that meet the requirements of one of the exceptionalities in Bulletin 1508",
