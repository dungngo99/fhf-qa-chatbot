# QA Chatbot System

To start the chat bot demo, in a terminal window navigate to the project folder. First, you will need to run the Python server via Flask, so (with Flask installed), type in the command:
```
 $ python main.py
```

Now that the back-end server is up and running, you'll need to open the chat index page with its own server. In a new terminal window, navigate to the project folder and type this command:
```
$ python3 -m http.server
```
Navigate to the URL of the port displayed. For example, if the terminal reads "Serving HTTP on :: port 8000", put the following web address into your browser: http://localhost:8000/

Success! Start asking questions.
